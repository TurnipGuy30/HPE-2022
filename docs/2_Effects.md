# Effects & Risks of Alcoholism

Alcohol affects each person differently, depending on factors such as:

- Physical and mental health and conditions
- Current medications or drugs
- The body's previous exposure to alcohol
- The amount being drunk
- The strength of the beverage

Alcohol is likely to have a stronger effect on a person who:

- Does not often drink alcohol
- Has a low tolerance to alcohol
- Is a younger person
- Weighs less

As a person drinks alcohol, it is passed into the blood through the stomach and/or small intestine walls, thus increasing the level of alcohol in the blood. It then flows to and affects almost all parts of the body, including the brain, changing the way they feel, think, and behave.

The level of alcohol in the blood is measured by a person's *blood alcohol concentration*, or BAC. One *standard drink* increases the average person's BAC by 0.02, and takes about an hour to break down. The more or faster a person drinks, the higher their BAC, and the longer it takes for the alcohol to break down.

> Extra facts:
> - BAC measures grams of alcohol per 100mL of blood; a BAC of 0.01 is equivalent to 0.01g/100mL.
> - A fully licensed driver in Australia is allowed to drive with a BAC of less than 0.05.

### Short-Term Effects

In small amounts, alcohol can make a person feel more relaxed, confident, or talkative. However, alcohol in larger doses can cause a variety of negative effects including any of the following:

- Loss of situational judgement
- Difficulty in movement; loss of balance and coordination
- Slurring speech patterns
- Nausea and vomiting
- Impaired emotional stability; mood swings
- Sleepiness
- Loss of muscle control (especially bladder); cannot walk without help
- Unconsciousness

A BAC over 0.30 may lead to coma or death.

### Long-Term Effects

Binge drinking can lead to addiction, which makes way for many possible long-term effects including physical and mental health issues. These may include various cancers, liver failure, fertility issues, dementia, stroke, and increased risk of suicide.

> ### Summary
>
> Possible short-term effects include accidental or deliberate injury to self or others, increased sexual behaviour, road accidents, hangovers, and alcohol poisoning.
>
> Possible long-term effects include addiction, diabetes, weight gain, impotence, cancers, brain damage, heart issues, liver failure, fertility issues, and increased risk of suicide.
