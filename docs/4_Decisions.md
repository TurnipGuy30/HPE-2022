# Healthy Decision-Making

When trying to quit alcoholism, there are a few things to keep in mind.

### Don't go 'cold turkey'

*'Cold turkey'* refers to the action of quitting all at once. During alcoholism, a person's entire body becomes addicted to the substance, much like other drugs. This means that trying to quit alcohol all at once can have a high impact on a person's physical and emotional health. Instead, a person should try to slowly decrease their alcohol intake over time.

### Remember why quitting is best

It's important to remember that quitting alcohol is the healthiest thing an alcoholic can do. It means a person will no longer experience the short-term effects of alcohol, giving the ability to think clearer and be healthier.

### Get help from others

It's always okay to ask for help from friends or family, or contact a dedicated organisation. You can find more information about these on [the `Strategies` page](3_Strategies.md).
